# iota-deploy
Deploy automatically full IOTA node on Linux

For now it's only automated for CentOS 7 but there are notes for Ubuntu

A much better install automated by Ansible is already available at https://github.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook

And another install automated by Puppet is available at https://github.com/craigwatson/puppet-iota

For AWS CloudFormation template look at https://github.com/iotFab/iota-aws-full-node
